## About this page
This website was my first project I sent to the world. It was a challenge for me. I'm happy with how the site looks and how it works since I had no experience with web design.
The project is built in Vue.js. I realize that Vue is not suitable for the type of such a simple web page, but I wanted to try it in vue to make friends with it.

I would like to thank Martin Pl√°vka who helped me and guided me :)
